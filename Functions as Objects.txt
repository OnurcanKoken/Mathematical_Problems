funtions are firs class objects:
-have types
-can be elements of data structures like lists
-can appear in expressions
 as part of an assignment statement
 as an argument to a funtion!!

particularly useful to use functions as arguments when coupled with lists
-aka higher order programming

generalization of hops
python provides a general purpose HOP, map
simple form - a unary funtion and a collection of suitable arguments
map(abs, [1, -2, 3, -4])
