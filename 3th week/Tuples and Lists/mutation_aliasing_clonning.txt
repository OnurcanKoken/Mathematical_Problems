mutation, aliasing, cloning

alias -> nick name
point the same information

warm = ['red', 'yellow', 'orange']
hot = warm
"""
here hot is an alias for warm - changing one changes the other!!!
they are pointing the same object, list
"""

note that there are two ways to sort:
sort() mutates the list but does not return anything
sorted() does not mutate the list, returns the sorted list

nested list -> list of list
