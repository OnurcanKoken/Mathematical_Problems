"""
run-length encoding algorithm
takes the occurrence of each repeating character
outputs the number along with a single character of the repeating sequence

For example: "wwwggopp" would return 3w2g1o2p
The given string will not contain any numbers,
punctuation, or symbols

Another example: "aabbcde" would return 2a2b1c1d1e
Another example: "wwwbbbw" would return 3w3b1w
