A tuple is an ordered sequence of elements,
it can include any different kind of element within them,
the sequence itself has an order!
we can reach them by simple indexing like we did with strings
They are immutable! Can not change element values
represented with parentheses
te = ()
t = (2,"one",3)
t[0] -> evaluates to 2
(2,"one",3)+(5,6) -> evaluates to (2,"one",3,5,6)
t[1:2] -> slice tuple, evaluates to ("one",)
t[1:3] -> slice tuple, evaluates to ("one",3)
t[1] = 4 -> gives error, can not modify an object

The parentheses designate that this is a tuple!

('one') gives you only string but ('one',) is a tuple
extra comma means this is a tuple
